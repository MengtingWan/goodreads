## Notebooks/Code Samples

We've created several notebooks (in python 3.7) to illustrate how to download/read these datasets, and provide some basic explorations of the data.

- [download.ipynb](/download.ipynb): If you prefer to download datasets without GUI. This notebook will show how to download files in bash/python.
- [samples.ipynb](/samples.ipynb): This notebook will show how to read '.json.gz' files line-by-line and display sample records of each file.
- [statistics.ipynb](/statistics.ipynb): This notebook will calculate some basic statistics of the datasets (except the largest complete interaction file 'goodreads_interactions.csv'). Running this notebook may take a while.
- [distributions.ipynb](/distributions.ipynb): This notebook will operate on the complete interaction file 'goodreads_interactions.csv' and provide some explorations of the distributions of these interactions. **Note: Run this notebook only when you have LARGE memory (recommend 32g+)!!**
- [reviews.ipynb](/reviews.ipynb): This notebook will calculate some statistics of the review datasets.
